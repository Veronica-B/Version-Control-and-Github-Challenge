1. Explain what the terminal is in your own words.

A terminal is a way to input commands for the computer to follow. This was the only way to use computers back in the day.

2. What is the major difference between Git and Github?

Git is a version control system, and Github is a repository hosting service (an online database), and you can share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer.

3. Why do we use Github?

Github is useful for when you have multiple developers working on a project. This way everybody can work on separate files, and merge them more often instead of merging it at the end, which can cause a host of problems to crop up.
